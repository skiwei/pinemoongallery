		<h2><a href="{{ url('/markingcolor') }}">Markingcolor Paintings</a></h2>
		<p>
		For the last 30 years Victor Wang has pioneered a new painting medium that applies powerful color qualities using marking inks on different types of paper. He calls the unique medium / technique "Markingcolor". 
		</p>
		<p>
		At this electronic and digital ﻿age, all "Markingcolor" paintings are re-created from the originals to digital images. They are all prints of high quality digital pigment by Giclee printing technology. Since it uses pigment print, the paintings can be printed on canvas or doubleweight matte paper. The image stability of pigment printing is superior to that of any other method of printing, including traditional silver-halide or metal-based. Normally the prints can be kept fresh for a long time. Pigment Giclee prints of the paintings are commonly acceptable for art-collections since 1980s. Numerous examples of giclee prints can be found in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Chelsea Galleries.

		Victor Wang not only is a great fine artist, but also a master of digital image creator himself. For all prints of Markingcolor paintings here, Wang goes through his unique re-creations for each one with his artistic eyes, manually highlights fine touch-up, artist prove (A/P), steel sealed, With limited edition, each painting "reprint" is a unique and valuable fine art collection.

		<h2><a href="{{ url('/newsong') }}">New Song Paintings</a></h2>
		<p>
		Paintings of China Song Dynasty (960-1279) represented a peak of this type of fine art. One well know style is realistic, and most famous painting of this type was "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" by artist Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145). The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all Chinese paintings, and it has been called "China's Mona Lisa."
		</p>
		<p>
		At the electronic age, Victor Wang uses modern high-resolution digital camera to collect landscape images, and create brand new images from his artist view. Then he uses hand-drawing software to "paint" it with fine details for each object. Traditional artists paint on paper or canvas medium, Wang paints on computer screen. This way he recreates ture realistic style of Song Dynasty paintings, and brings the art to a new high level. The artist calls his innovation as "New Song" painting. It's a time consuming process. Some of the New Song paintings need many months to years to finish. It's very realistic, but the images are not photo's combinations. Wang stands at the frontier of the electronic age.
		</p>
		<p>
		Even though it's very time consuming, but Wang had finished more than 100 New Song paintings.
